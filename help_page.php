		HELP</h1>
	<div class="text"><p> Our project basically aims to provide answers for the user or come up with a solution according to user’s specifications by using tags. A user to the system is identified as an anonymous user or a regular user. Throughout the remaining of the texts the regular users will be referred as “users”. The different between the anonymous users and the users is that to be considered as a user, a person must log in to the system. If the person is not logged in, he/she is considered as an anonymous user. Anonymous users can only see discover panel and they cannot see the answers for the questions or answer the questions. Everybody can sign up to the system. Once logged in, users can simply answer others’ question to gain reputation based on how good their answers are, votes others’ questions or answers and comments. Using the question panel, users can post questions. Questions will contain tags to make it easier to find for potential answerers. In profile panel, users can select the tags they are interested in. Users can also create special tags, that is, they will declare the topics they are familiar with and have a potential to answer them. In answer panel, a user will see the questions with his special tags.  
Then user can click the question to go to question page. Each question can have multiple answers. Any user can also add answers to each question. If there are answers in the questions each user can up-vote or down-vote an answer stating the helpfulness of the answer. The answers with more up-votes will appear first in the answers. Similarly the user will get points for each up-vote he gets for the questions and the reliability of that user in that tag will increase. Similarly the answer panel, the users will see the questions related to their interest tags. Administrators will see the system really similar to the Users but they will have more buttons. They won't have any specialty or interest. Instead, they will be able to see each page with the same rules but without tag filtering. 
They will be able to:
leave admin comments to the questions
block a question ( nobody will be able to answer the question )
block a user ( the user will not be able to ask/answer 
delete a question
delete a user
directly manipulate the database
add more admins
The administrators will have one additional page that is the database page. In this page, he will be able to directly manipulate the database and change schemas.
